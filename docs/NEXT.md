# Next tasks (handover, 2026-10-21)

All work is on branch `claude/gallant-volta-65ov5k` (not merged into `main` yet: open a PR and merge it).
Latest IPA: app **0.1.5** from the "iOS IPA" workflow on that branch (Actions → latest run → artifact `gow3-ios-Release-ipa`).

## Where things stand
| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Built-in JIT (no StikDebug) | **Works on the iPhone 17** (in-app pairing, helper extension). docs/JIT.md |
| Memory | AltStore keeps `increased-memory-limit`: 6143 MB limit, 64 GiB free window at `0x70_0000_0000`. File-backed guest memory costs 0 MB. Install/refresh **only with AltStore** (SideStore drops the entitlement). |
| GPU facts | A19: `bc_textures` true (PS4 BC1–BC7 textures sample directly), 4 GB max buffer, 5.3 GB working set |
| Runtime | `native/runtime` (gow3_android src/, iOS port). Compiles for iOS; Linux tests pass (`native/runtime/tests/run.sh`) |
| Loader | CPU-only start in the app works: boot file accepted, patches applied, image mapped, **libc (module 0) init ran through FEX and returned 0**, 2.8 GB direct memory mapped in the window |
| Blocker | The game thread **stops while starting linked module 1** (app stays responsive; no crash) |

## 1. Find why module 1 stops (do this first)
1. Copy the full game (`ENGLISH/`, `EXEC/`, `*.plt`) to `Documents/gow3/game/` to rule out missing files:
   ```sh
   ideviceinstaller -l | grep -i gow3            # bundle id (AltStore adds the team id)
   ifuse --documents <bundle id> ~/iphone
   cp -r game/ENGLISH game/EXEC game/sce_discmap.plt ~/iphone/gow3/game/
   cp "_Update to v1.02/game/"*.plt ~/iphone/gow3/game/
   fusermount -u ~/iphone
   ```
2. Install 0.1.5, Enable JIT, Start game (CPU only). When it stops at `Starting linked module 1`, wait ~20 s,
   tap **Dump threads**, and read `Documents/gow3/loader.log`: each thread prints guest RIP (`image-relative=`),
   its rbp chain, the thread name and the host symbols it is in.
3. Likely causes to check against the dump:
   - waiting on a runtime primitive (`runtime_sema.c`, `runtime_mutex.c`, cond waits): Darwin's CLOCK_REALTIME
     waits or the polled timed locks in `compat_darwin.c`;
   - a guest spin loop (phone gets warm): a TSC/time source (`guest_cpu_tsc`, `runtime_time.c`) or an atomic
     the guest polls;
   - a host call into a stub that never returns (`native/runtime/ios/stub_*.c`);
   - an unresolved import trap (would normally print `unresolved` and exit).
4. Useful extra logging: `GOW3_TRACE_SEMA=1` (set with `setenv` in `startGameCpuOnly` in
   `app/modules/gow3-core/ios/Gow3CoreModule.swift`) prints every blocking semaphore wait.
5. FEX prints `Failed to mprotect last page of code buffer`: its 4 KiB guard page cannot be protected on 16 KiB
   pages. Harmless so far; patch `PooledAllocatorVirtualWithGuard` to a host page later (docs/AUDIT.md).

## 2. Finish the runtime (milestone 4)
- **Audio**: replace `runtime_audio.c`'s SDL3 output with AudioQueue/AVAudioEngine (same `runtime_audio_resolve` exports).
- **Pad**: `runtime_pad.c` on the GameController framework (DualSense/DS4/Xbox/Backbone).
- **FFmpeg for iOS** for `runtime_mp3.c` and `runtime_videodec.c` (cutscenes). Until then `ios/stub_media.c`.
- **boot.bin on the phone**: port gow3's `scripts/prepare.py`, `link_libc.py`, `link_modules.py`,
  `content_profile.py`, `patches.py` (Python) to C or Swift, so no PC is needed.
- Add the new sources to `native/cmake/gow3core.cmake` and `native/runtime/build-ios-check.sh`.

## 3. GPU (milestone 5, the big one)
- Port gow3_android `gpu/` (shadPS4 video core + shim) to iOS: MoltenVK (static), a CAMetalLayer from a native
  fullscreen UIViewController (`window_ios.mm`), SPIR-V → MSL through MoltenVK.
- Smoke test first: `src/vulkan_smoke.c` on the device, then the title screen.
- Replace `native/runtime/ios/stub_gpu.c` with the real library; remove `--cpu-only` from the start button.
- Render low (gow3 already has 480p/720p patches) and upscale with MetalFX spatial; frame generation only later.

## 4. Optimisation (milestone 6)
- Measure `phys_footprint` while playing; keep anonymous memory under ~6 GB (guest pool is file-backed already).
- JIT pool size (256 MiB now; Madeira uses 640–896 MiB), FEX options, thermals.
